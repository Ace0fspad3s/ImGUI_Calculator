# ImGUI_Calculator
A Learning project, developing a C++ Windows' Application with a **real-time** GUI

## Description
As for most new programmers, developing a calculator is a useful way to learn a language.
I've worked with C++ as my first language awhile ago and decided to brush off the dust as well as challenge myself, as at the time I was also working on a project in Unreal Engine 5.

### Notes

Instead of running a terminal, I wanted to take a shot at developing a windows application complete with a Real-time UI. 
Admittedly, I was in way over my head as It was a much larger undertaking than I originally thought it was going to be, but I learned SO MUCH on throughout the weeks i've spent. Most of the time spent was getting into CPP's, RAII groove ðŸ˜Ž.
I originally used D3DX12, but reverted to D3DX11 due to its simplicity.

* Windows10 SDK/Win32 API - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/apiindex/windows-api-list
* Using DearImGui for the UI - https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
* Direct X 11: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/_direct3d11/

At this time most of the work that is complete is the backend systems for managing the Windows HND and a simple D3DX11 swapchain.
Currently I have a windows application running in a 640x480 window displaying a flat color background.
